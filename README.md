## [B. Tasks in ST Data Analysis](#content) 
**B.1 Cell type identification** <br/>
   There are two general approaches for estimating cell type composition: <br/>
   a. to evaluate the enrichment of cell type-specific markers among the experessed genes at each spot <br/>
   b. deconvolution, to quantitatively eastimate the proportion of different cell types at each location <br/>
